# **Forage: British Airways Virtual Experience üõ´‚ú®**

Welcome to the British Airways Virtual Experience repository! üåü This space offers an immersive exploration into understanding customer sentiments through web scraping and predictive modeling.

## Task 1: Web Scraping for Company Insight üï∏Ô∏è

Explore the realm of web scraping to gain valuable insights into British Airways. By harnessing Python's capabilities and the BeautifulSoup library, this task involves collecting and analyzing online reviews from Skytrax. Delve into passenger sentiments, uncover trends, and understand the pulse of the audience through their feedback.

Observation:

from the plot above passenger sentiments from the reviews, we observe the following distribution:

* A significant majority of the reviews, accounting for 79.1%, express satisfaction and positive experiences with the airline.

* and 20.9% of the reviews indicate areas where passengers may have encountered challenges or issues during their interactions with the airline.

This distribution underscores the predominantly positive sentiment in the reviews, while also highlighting areas of improvement for the airline's services and customer experiences.

In our word cloud analysis of British Airways (BA) reviews, we embarked on a quest to uncover insightful keywords and phrases. While the word cloud did not reveal particularly prominent interesting keywords,

our focus shifted toward identifying potential negative keywords. like example heathrow, delay, still service, late etc.

The top three influential features in our analysis are 'booking_origin' for Malaysia, 'booking_origin' for Australia, and 'length_of_stay.' These features played a significant role in the predictive capacity of our model, contributing notably to the outcomes and insights drawn from our analysis.
